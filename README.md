# Tiny games

A collection of tiny games

# Instructions

To build all games:
```bash
make
```


To build the binaries you need to have the sdl2 development files
installed, on debian based system this can be done as follows:

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

To generate this readme
```bash
make readme
```

Note that qrencode needs to be installed as this is what I use to generate the games as qr codes
